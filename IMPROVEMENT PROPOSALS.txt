IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS

1
should implement genes of the same type as a 2D list where each row is a new gene with its properties,
this way we could access a certain property of all the genes simply by genes[:][property]

2
dependign on improvement 1, make the program work with dicts instead of classes. This would be a bit faster.
Classes are being used at the moment since they make it more readale and might make the code easier to translate
to another language
